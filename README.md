# Cell-Specific-Effects-of-Temporal-Interference-Stimulation-on-Cortical-Function-Code
The Code for the Computational Studies done in the paper "Cell-Specific-Effects-of-Temporal-Interference-Stimulation-on-Cortical-Function-Code". The code for implementing neuron models was taken from the code base provided in the publication "Aberra, A.S., Peterchev, A.V., Grill, W.M.: Biophysically realistic neuron models for simulation of cortical stimulation. Journal of neural engineering 15(6), 066023 (2018)" and appropriately modified.
