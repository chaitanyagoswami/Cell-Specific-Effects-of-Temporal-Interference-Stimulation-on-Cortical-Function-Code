# Cell-Specific-Effects-of-Temporal-Interference-Stimulation-on-Cortical-Function-Code
The Code for the Computational Studies done in the paper "Cell-Specific-Effects-of-Temporal-Interference-Stimulation-on-Cortical-Function-Code". The code for implementing neuron models was taken from the code base provided in the publication "Aberra, A.S., Peterchev, A.V., Grill, W.M.: Biophysically realistic neuron models for simulation of cortical stimulation. Journal of neural engineering 15(6), 066023 (2018)" and appropriately modified. The python code was implemented in Python version 3.10.12. The MATLAB code for generating experimental figures was implemented in R2023a and the MATLAB code for running computational study was implemented in R2019. If using this code, please also cite the the original publication:
