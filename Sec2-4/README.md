Code for running computational studies presented in Section 2.4 of the work "Cell Specific Effects of Temporal Interference Stimulation on Cortical Function".

For running the code: 

1. Unzip the cells.zip and mechansims.zip files.
2. Run the following commmand in the terminal: sh init_setup_run_once.sh
3. To reproduce the results of Sec 2.4.1 run the following command in the terminal: sh run_pointElec_sim.sh
4. To reproduce the results of Sec 2.4.2 run the following command in the terminal: sh run_non-invasive_sim.sh
5. To reproduce the results of Sec 2.4.3 run the following command in the terminal: sh run_TI_sim.sh
